Components and specifics of the Infrastructure:
===============================================

Server:
-------
A physical or virtual machine that hosts an infrastructure or an operating system, usually located in a data center.

Web Server (Nginx):
-------------------
Nginx serves as the web server in this case and it handles web pages (static content)

Application Server:
-------------------
This handles web requests dynamically running application codebases, and generating dynamic content.

Application Files (Codebase):
-----------------------------
The website's codebase, containing all necessary files and scripts needed to execute your web application.

Database (MySQL):
-----------------
MySQL serves as the relational database management system, storing the website's data.

Role of the Domain Name:
------------------------
The domain name (e.g., "foobar.com") provides a human-readable address for accessing the website, which is easier to remember than an IP address.

Type of DNS Record for www.foobar.com:
--------------------------------------
The DNS record "www" in "www.foobar.com" is a CNAME record, which points to the domain name: foobar.com with the IP (8.8.8.8)

Communication with User's Computer:
-----------------------------------
The server communicates with the user's computer over the Internet using the HTTP protocol.
The user's browser sends an HTTP request to the server, which responds with the requested web content


Issues with the Infrastructure:
===============================

Single Point of Failure (SPOF):
-------------------------------
Since all components are hosted on a single server, any failure in the hardware or software of that server could lead to the entire website crashing.
There is no back up components in case of failure.

Downtime During Maintenance:
----------------------------
When performing maintenance tasks like deploying new code, the web server needs to be restarted, causing downtime during the restart process.

Inability to Scale Under Heavy Traffic:
---------------------------------------
With only one server handling all requests, the infrastructure may struggle to handle a sudden increase in traffic, leading to slow response times or even downtime.
Scaling is not possible on this infrastructure and if the server capacity is reached, the server may crash
