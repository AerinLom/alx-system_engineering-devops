Additional Elements and Their Purpose:
======================================

2 Servers (Server 2 & 3):
-------------------------
To host additional application instances and act as replica database servers in case of failure.

Load Balancer (HAProxy):
------------------------
To distribute incoming traffic across multiple application servers for better performance and failure precautions.


Specifics of what was added:
============================

Load Balancer Distribution Algorithm:
-------------------------------------
Configured with a round-robin distribution algorithm.
This algorithm evenly distributes incoming requests among the available application servers in a sequential manner.

Active-Active vs. Active-Passive Setup:
---------------------------------------
We are using an active-active setup to allow for load balancing between all possible servers.
Active-Active Setup: Both application servers are actively serving traffic simultaneously, providing load balancing and redundancy.
Active-Passive Setup: One application server is actively serving traffic while the other acts as a standby, ready to take over in case of failure.

Database Primary-Replica Cluster:
---------------------------------
Involves two database nodes: Primary (Master) and Replica (Slave).
Primary node handles read-write operations, while the Replica node duplicates data from the Primary node
and serves read-only operations (synchronisation of data).
Data duplication ensures data redundancy and failure security.


Issues with the Infrastructure:
===============================

Single Points of Failure (SPOFs):
---------------------------------
Load Balancer represents a single point of failure.
Lack of redundancy with the Load Balancer could mean server downtime if it fails.

Security Issues:
----------------
Absence of a firewall in the infrastructure allows for potential security threats.
Lack of HTTPS encryption leaves data transmitted between the server and users vulnerable to malicious attacks.

Lack of Monitoring:
-------------------
No monitoring capabilities mean that server performance can not be analysed and therefore making improvements are not possible.
