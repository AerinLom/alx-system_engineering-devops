Additional Elements:
====================

Firewalls:
----------
Each server will have a firewall to control incoming and outgoing traffic.
This adds an additional layer of security to the infrastructure.

SSL Certificate:
----------------
A valid SSL certificate will be installed on the Load Balancer to serve www.foobar.com over HTTPS.
This allows for secure encrypted communication between clients and the website, protecting sensitive data from interception and tampering.

Monitoring Clients (Data Collectors):
-------------------------------------
Each server will have a monitoring client, which collects performance metrics, and other valuable data and sends it to a monitoring service like Sumo Logic.
This allows real-time monitoring and alerts for system health and performance issues.

Traffic Served Over HTTPS:
--------------------------
HTTPS encrypts the data transmitted between the client's browser and the web server, ensuring confidentiality and improved security.
It prevents eavesdropping and data tampering, as well as other malicious attacks.

Monitoring Purpose:
-------------------
Monitoring is used to track the performance of the infrastructure in real-time.
It helps detect and resolve issues, maintaining optimal performance.

Monitoring Web Server QPS:
--------------------------
To monitor the web server's Query Per Second (QPS), you can configure the monitoring tool to track the number of  requests received by the web server over a specific time period.
If the QPS is too high an alert can be raised.


Issues with the Infrastructure:
===============================

Terminating SSL at Load Balancer Level:
---------------------------------------
Terminating SSL at the load balance, leaves traffic unencrypted between the load balancer and the servers.
This creates security risks if the internal network is exposed.

Single MySQL Server Accepting Writes:
-------------------------------------
Having only one MySQL server capable of accepting writes represents a single point of failure. If this server fails, the application can not write to the database and will cause database inaccuracy.

Identical Servers with Same Components:
---------------------------------------
Having servers with identical components can create downtime if there's an issue affecting one type of component, as it could affect all servers simultaneously

SPOF with the load balancer:
----------------------------
Only having 1 load balancer means that if it somehow fails, the whole infrastructure will lose functionality.
